def guessing_game():
    """
    Plays a number guessing game with the user.
    
    This interactive game demonstrates while loops, conditionals, and user input
    handling. The user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between
    1 and 100, receiving feedback after each guess.

    Game Flow:
    1. Generate a random secret number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
    2. Prompt the user with clear instructions
    3. Use a while loop to continue until the user guesses correctly
    4. For each guess:
       - Convert user input to integer
       - Compare guess to secret number
       - Provide feedback: "Too high!", "Too low!", or success
       - Count attempts
    5. When correct, congratulate user and show number of attempts
    6. Exit the game

    Input Validation:
    - Assume user will enter valid integers (error handling not required)
    
    Example Game Session:
    --------
    Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
    I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
    Enter your guess: 50
    Too high! Try again.
    Enter your guess: 25
    Too low! Try again.
    Enter your guess: 37
    Congratulations! You guessed it in 3 attempts!
